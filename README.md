# ConvolutionalNetwork-Workflow

This is a walkthrough of building a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to predict labels of the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
The contents are split in two Google Colab notebooks

- 0_Simple_Model.ipynb
- 1_Improved_Model.ipynb

The first model guides the reader through a simple setup of a CNN and adds regularization after evaluating results.
The second model illustrates how the model's accuracy can be further increased by adding features such as data augmentation, a more complex network architecture, batch normalization, and dropout.

It is recommended to run both notebooks in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#scrollTo=P-H6Lw1vyNNd).
